//! Text you can select with the pointer and copy out of.
//!
//! bezel has the two hard halves already: [`markdown::render_with`] paints a
//! [`Selection`] it is handed, and fills a [`BlockLayouts`] whose
//! [`BlockLayouts::hit`] turns a point back into a [`Cursor`]. What it has no
//! notion of is the *gesture* — press, drag, release — because that belongs to
//! whoever owns the selection, and only an editor ever did.
//!
//! This is that gesture and nothing else. The selection, which item holds it and
//! what copying means all stay the caller's. See [`super`].
